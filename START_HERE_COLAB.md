## ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### Data Privacy
- Google Colab is temporary
- Your data is deleted when session ends
- Only saved data is in your Drive
- Colab terms don't allow selling your data

### Timing
- First model takes longer (downloading models ~5-10 min)
- Subsequent models are faster
- Total: 2-4 hours is realistic
- Better to run continuously than pause/resume

### Common Issues (All Solvable)
- GPU not available? → Change runtime type
- Out of memory? → Edit cluster sample size
- Slow downloads? → Normal, wait 10-15 mins
- Results missing? → Refresh Drive

**All solutions in:** `COLAB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` FAQ section
